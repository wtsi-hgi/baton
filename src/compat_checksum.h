// iRODS 3.x shares the same checksum API as iRODS 4.0.x, while 4.1.x
// uses openssl directly. Backwards compatibility was broken for the
// iRODS checksum API in 4.1.0. Since baton needs to continue support
// for both 3.3.1 and 4.1.x this compatability shim was introduced and
// baton's support for iRODS 4.0.x discontinued. It's a long-winded way
// of doing things, but it's very clear what's going on.

// MD5_CTX is the symbol that clashes between iRODS 3.x/4.0.x MD5 and
// OpenSSL MD5. We just use whichever is present, which the ifdefs
// ensure will be the correct one.
